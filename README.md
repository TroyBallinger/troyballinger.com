This website serves as both a testing grounds for me to practice web techniques as well as to host my resume and contact info. The vast majority of my previous work is proprietary, so I can't put many work samples on GitHub. This simple website is to demonstrate I'm not entirely inept as a programmer.

All code was written by me, so you may use or copy anything you'd like to.
